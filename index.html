                <p>An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young
                    Frog into the mud.</p>
                <p>The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.</p>
                <p><span class="quote">"A great big monster,"</span> said one of them, <span class="quote">stepped on

                <p><span class="quote">"Big, was he!"</span> said the old Frog, puffing herself up.
                    <span class="quote">"Was he as big as this?"</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">"Oh, much bigger!"</span> they cried.</p>
                <p>The Frog puffed up still more.</p>
                <p><span class="quote">"He could not have been bigger than this."</span> she said. But the little Frogs
                    all declared that the monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more
                    and more until, all at once, she burst.</p>

            <h1>The Fox & The Grapes</h1>
            <p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a
                tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at
                them.</p>
            <p>The bunch hung from a hugh branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it
                by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once
                more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p>
            <p>Now he say down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"What a fool I am."</span> he said. <span class="quote">"Here I am wearing myself out
                to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."</span></p>
            <p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>

            <h1>Belling The Cat</h1>
            <p>The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least
                they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed
                , something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared
                stir from their dens by night or day.</p>
            <p>Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up
                and said: <span class="quote">"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.
                All we have to do is to hang a belt about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know
                immediately that our enemy is coming."</span></p>
            <p>All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of
                rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said: <span class="quote">"I will say that
                plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?"</span></p>
            <p id="moral">It is one thing to say something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.</p>

            <h1>The Wolf & The Crane</h1>
            <p>A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it
                neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of
                affairs for a greedy wolf.</p>
            <p>So away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able
                to reach the bone and pull it out.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"I will reward you very handsomely,"</span> said the Wolf, <span class="quote">"if
                you pull that bone out for me."</span></p>
            <p>The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was
                grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.</p>
            <p>When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.</p> 
            <p><span class="quote">"But what about my reward!"</span> called the Crane anxiously.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"What!"</span> snarled the Wolf, whirling around. <span class="quote">"Haven't you
                got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?"</span></p>

            <h1>The Lion & The Mouse</h1>
            <p>A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him
                unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap,
                the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"Spare me!"</span> begged the poor Mouse. <span class="quote">"Please let me go and
                some day I will surely repay you."</span></p>
            <p>The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let
                the Mouse go.</p>
            <p>Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's
                net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and
                quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she
                gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see that even a
                Mouse can help a Lion."</span></p>

                Bull's pardon for having used his horn for a resting place.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"You must be very glad to have me go away now,"</span> he said.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"It's all the same to me,"</span> replied the Bull. <span class="quote">"I did not

            <p>A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds. When the wind blew, the great Oak stood
                proudly upright with its hundred arms uplifted to the sky. But the Reeds bowed low in the wind and sang
                a sad and mournful song.</p>
            <p><span class="quote">"You have reason to complain."</span> said the Oak. <span class="quote">"The
                slightest breeze that ruffles the surface of the water makes you bow your heads, while I, the mighty
                Oak, stan upright and firm before the howling tempest."</span></p>
            <p><span class="quote">"Do not worry about us,"</span> replied the Reeds. <span class="quote">"The winds do
                not harm us. We bow before them and so we do not break. You, in all your pride an strength, have so far
                resisted their blows. But the end is coming."</span></p>
            <p>As the Reeds spoke a great hurricane rushed out of the north. The Oak stood proudly and fought against
                the storm, while the yielding Reeds bowed low. The wind redoubled in fury, and all at one the great
                tree fell, torn up by the roots, and lay among the pitying Reeds.</p>
